# gravsim
 Particle simulation of fluid in gravity, with container.

## Questions
* Good value for particle mass?~~can be investigated
* Should I do dampening? with gravity and no energy loss, hard to tell if falling and bouncing or just bouncing
* Break up the system?
* No periodic boundary? Optimizations like only need to compute forces for nearby atoms?
